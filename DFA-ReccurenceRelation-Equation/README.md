Summary: This project consists of two parts. The first part utilizes a systematically generated DFA with over 1,300 states , each with four outgoing transitions
to calculate the total number of possible strings accepted by a DFA of length N. Using memoitization this project is able to compute strings 300+ instantly wheras a 
direct approach to calculating these strings would be in exponential time. Part two of this project utilizes a similar approach to find the minimum length string accepted
by a DFA.
